For the admin, an analytics dashboard provides insightful sales analytics and reports.


Technologically, the backend is powered by Django and Django Rest Framework, while the frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a sleek and modern look. PostgreSQL serves as the database, ensuring reliable and efficient data management. The project is deployed using Docker and AWS for scalable and robust deployment.
